        <h4>Relational Operators</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>===</strong> strict, comparison operator, true or false<br>
          equality comparison<br>
          if (currentForecast === "sunny") {<br>
            let recommendation = "leave your jacket at home";<br>
          }<br><br>

          <strong>==</strong> loose, compares different data types<br><br>

          <strong>=</strong> assignment (one equals sign)<br>
          let currentForecast = "sunny";<br><br>

          <strong><, >, <=, >=</strong> less than, greater than, '' or equal to<br><br>
          
          <strong>!==</strong> not equal, opposite of ===
        </p>




        <h4>Logical Operators</h4>
        <p>
          combine boolean values so that you can express more complex ideas

          && and, evaluates to true if the values on both are true
          || or,  evaluates to true if either one is true
          !  not, works on just one value
          
          let userLoggedIn = true;
          let userPurchasedItem = false;
          // test if both values are true
          userLoggedIn && userPurchasedItem; // => false
          // test if either value is true
          userLoggedIn || userPurchasedItem; // => true
          // invert the value of a variable
          !userLoggedIn; // => false
          !userPurchasedItem; // => true
          
          short-circuiting
          code stops early if the first value of the || operator is truthy. 
          returns the first truthy value, or the last value if no values are truthy
          code stops early if the first value of the && operator is falsy. 
          returns the first falsy value, or the last value if no values are falsy.

        </p>





        <h4>Increment and Decrement</h4>
        <p>
          var++ //adds one to the number currently stored in the variable
          var-- // subtracts one from variable
          var+= 2 // adds 2 each time

      <article id = "data-types">
        <h3>Data Types</h3>
        <p>
          Strings - text or numbers in " " or ' '
          // declare a string with quotes
          let city = "Seattle";
          let state = "Washington"; 
          
          Numbers - Integers (whole numbers) and floating point decimal numbers (2.345)
          
          Booleans - True or False
          // declare a boolean
          let isLoggedIn = true;
          // evaluate a boolean
          if (isLoggedIn) {
            console.log("The user is logged in.");
          Pronounced 'not' or 'bang', ! inverts a boolean value. 
          This means that !false turns into true, and !true turns into false.
          
          Null - is a data type that's used to indicate that a variable has no value. 
          null is used as the default value when other data is not available. 
          Even though null is a distinct data type, typeof will tell you that it's an object
          
          Undefined - is a special value that means that a variable was never defined. 
          null value means that the developer decided that the value was empty on purpose. 
          An undefined value means that the value was never assigned. 
          you shouldn't assign a variable undefined. 
          If you want to represent the absence of a value in your code, use null instead
          let example = null;
          example; // null
          let magicWord;
          magicWord; // undefined
        </p>


        <h4>Converting Data Types</h4>
        <p>
            If you combine a number with a string using the + operator, the resulting value will be a string. This process of automatic conversion is called coercion. Only +

            parseInt() parses a string and returns an integer. But notably, parseInt returns only integers, like -5, 0, 111, 22,847, etc. It doesn't deal with decimals, like 1.618. But that's where parseFloat() comes in.
            
            toString() which turns a number into a string
            let age = 101;
            let ageString = age.toString();
            typeof age; // 'number'
            typeof ageString; // 'string'
            

        </p>

      </article>


      <article id = "methods">
        <h3>Methods</h3>
        <p>
          functions in code that do stuff

          .length // get the length of a string, number of characters
          "Hello".length; // 5
          let longWord = "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious";
          longWord.length; // 34
          not really a method because it's not manipulating
          
          .toLowerCase() : This returns a string with all the letters lowercase.
          
          .replace("part of string", "new string") : This replaces part of a string with another string.
          
          .toUpperCase() : This returns a string with all the letters capitalized.
          
          .trim() : This removes whitespace (spaces, tabs, etc.) at the beginning and end of a string.
          
          because there's no = operator to reassign the value, 
          methods usually don't change the original value of the variable
        </p>

        <h4>Array Methods</h4>
        <p>
          .push(): adds an item to the end of an array. returns the new length of the array.

          .pop(): removes the last item from the end of an array. returns the last item.
          
          .length: Just like the string tool .length, this gives the length of the arrayâ€”in other words, the number of items. You'll notice that .length doesn't need parentheses. That's because it's technically a property and not a method.
          
          "to change the original" is to mutate
          push and pop will mutate an array, but length will not
        </p>
      </article>


      <article id ="if-else">
        <h3>If</h3>
        <p>
          conditional statement tells the code to perform different tasks based on 
          different kinds of information

          let userLoggedInToday = true;
          if (userLoggedInToday) {
            console.log("Thanks for logging in today!");
          }
          
          code inside {} runs only if () is true
        </p>
        <h4>Else</h4>
        <p>
          backup plan for the code

          let userLoggedInToday = false;
          if (userLoggedInToday) {
            // this code will not run!
            console.log("Thanks for logging in today!");
          } else {
            // this code will run
            console.log("Don't forget to log in today!");
          }<br><br>
          
          <strong>else if</strong> - for multiple conditions
        </p>
        <h4>Boolean Coercion</h4>
        <p>
          if you write an if statement with an item that isn't a boolean, JavaScript will convert your data into true or false
          // values that evaluate to false
          false; // false itself
          ""; // empty string
          0; // zero
          null;
          undefined;
          NaN; // Not a Number
          anything else is true
          
          !! 'double bang' turns anything to a boolean.
          !!true // true
          !!false // false
          !!10 // true
          !!0 // false
          !!(-8) // true
          !!"hello" // true
          !!"" // false
          !!" " // true
          !!undefined // false
          !!NaN // false
          !!null // false

          must be structured in a particular way. The square brackets [ and ] show where the array starts and ends. A comma , separates each item in the array, but there's no comma after the last item
          zero or more elements. Arrays can contain any data typeâ€”including other arrays
          
          access an item in an array using bracket notation and the index of that item

          we run the function by putting () after the name. arguments are  inserted as strings between the (). body of the function, encapsulated by curly brackets {}
          When we declare a function, we are just describing how we want it to behave. To actually trigger the function, you have to invoke it.

          ``return //  use it in front of the final result that you want to share outside of the function
          as opposed to console.log(), which only shows in console and remains undefined, return allows the result to be referenced within the program
          
          function returnsTen() {
            return 10;
          }
          let eleven = returnsTen() + 1; // becomes 10 + 1
          console.log(eleven); // 11
          
          Whenever JavaScript sees return in a function, it:
          
          stops running the code in that function
          takes the value to the right of return
          swaps in the return value where the function was called
          
          function add(num1, num2) {
            if (num1 < 0 || num2 < 0) {
              return "Only positive numbers please!";
            }
            return num1 + num2;
          }
          console.log(add(1, 4));
          console.log(add(-1, 4));
          //You can use return in multiple places in your function and a good example of that is if you include a conditional statement inside the body.

          Certain web files will open within the browser window when you link to them. These include web files (.html & .css) and images (jpg, .gif, and .png).

          When non-web files (.zip, pdf, .doc) are linked, those will be downloaded to the userâ€™s computer. If you want the link to download web files, then the attribute download can be added to the link to specify that the file should be downloaded.
          
          Since all files need to follow specific filename rules which can appear messy with the hyphens, etc, the downloaded file can be auto-renamed to use a more friendly filename upon download.

        If you wish to style the email links differently than the rest of your page links, a unique pseudo class is available to target links that start with "mailto:".
        <br><br>
        //  CSS STYLES <br>
         //  Normal Link <br>
          a {<br>
            font-family: arial;<br>
            text-decoration: none;<br>
            color: blue;<br>
          }<br>
          <br>
         //  Email Link <br>
          a[href^="mailto:"]{<br>
              color: red;<br>
          }<br>
          <br>
          <br>
        CSS allows you to supply the keyword !important in order to make a rule, which might otherwise be lower in the cascade, override others. Here's an example:
        <br><br>
        p {<br>
          color: red !important;<br>
        }<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        There are four pseudo-class selectors for anchor elements:<br>
        <br>
        a:link: This is the normal state of a text link.<br>
        a:visited: This is the state of a text link that has been visited already by the current web browser.
        <br>a:hover: This creates the roll-over state for when the user's mouse rolls over (aka hovers over) a link.
        <br>a:active: This affects the state of the link while the user is actively clicking on it.
        <br>Due to the cascading aspect of CSS, the order these pseudo-classes are written within the CSS page is very important.
        <br>
        They must be written in this order:<br>
        <br>
        link<br>
        visited<br>
        hover<br>
        active<br>
